I've conducted an in-depth analysis of Swiggy's performance in 2019 using the 'Funnel Case Study Data' workbook. Here's a concise summary of the insights generated:

Identified trends in the number of orders using Session Details sheet, filling all relevant columns based on provided definitions.
Determined dates of highs and lows in orders compared to the same day last week, accounting for natural weekend fluctuations.
Analyzed changes in traffic compared to the same day last week, identifying traffic sources using Channel wise traffic sheet.
Examined changes in Overall Conversion and broke it down into smaller metrics (L2M, M2C, C2P, P2O) in the Session Sheet.
Identified fluctuating conversion rates and created hypotheses to explain the fluctuations.
Validated hypotheses using Supporting data, ensuring thorough understanding of performance drivers and potential improvements."
